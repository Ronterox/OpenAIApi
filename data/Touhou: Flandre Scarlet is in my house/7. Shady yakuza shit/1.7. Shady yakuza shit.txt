"Shit! Fuck!" Oh no, gunshots. The worst thing is, I did not hear that from the phone. "Man, you gotta get out of there. I mean it! Shit is getting real!" I could sense the distress and urge of Jun's voice. My fists balled themselves, my teeth biting my lips. "Get out from there man. Shit…"

"No, damn it Jun! I did say that I'll bail right away, but not without you." I pulled out my gun, because this is the only choice I had. "Now you tell me where you are sitting your rich little ass over, I'm coming there to get you." I run, straight towards where I heard the gun shots. They're growing even louder, which means bad news for me. Fuck, I have no knowledge on using a gun.

"Thanks man. I'm in the central, the fountain, where we split off?" I nodded while uttering affirmative. "I'm in hiding, I'm inside one of the cars. A red… Porsche, you can't miss it-" More gunshots, and they seem to be near to Jun. "Fuck! Shit man hurry!" the line was closed. I put back my phone inside my pocket, while my other hand is busy on cocking the gun that I have with me.

"Okay Rei… you're going into some deep shit tonight…" I muttered to myself.

I head straight, immediately, for the alley. They're crowded, since people are panicking. They're evacuating, and I don't know where they're going but I'm pretty sure it's not prison. I managed to make my way out the alleyway.

"Fire! Don't let them get to the boss!"

"Shit!"

"Gah!"

I'm about to enter a freaking crossfire! I bit my lower lip. Need to think… think Rei… think… my eyes caught sight of a ladder. Perfect. I began to reach for the ladder, and thankfully, I managed to reach it. I climbed up. The rooftops are much safer than the stree-

"Waaaah!"

"Shi-!"

Or not. I paused mid climbing. I can't believe that they're shooting even on the rooftops. What now… need to think. Yeah! I peeked up from my cover, trying to figure out whose men is it that killed the people here. Shit… they're wearing green, not red. Damn, and here I hope I don't have to get into trouble. I pulled my weight, launching myself to the roof. I crouched, not wanting to be seen. If I'm seen I'm dead, and no dinner with Sakuya-san tonight.

Finding a place for cover, I settled for an air vent. It's large enough to cover me, but I know that it won't stop those men from getting here. I heard footsteps, shit, they're getting close. I need to make a distraction… but what… I felt something hard near my legs. It's a brick. I grabbed the brick with my free hand. I peeked out, finding a place where I would aim my throw. I saw an empty and darker place of the roof, I could throw that far.

I aimed, and throw the brick as far and hard as I can. I crossed my fingers, hoping that my plan would work.

"Hey, what's that…?"

"Don't know, better check it out. You wait here."

"Alright."

Shit… but at least I managed to get one of the fella away. I move silently towards another cover, doing so unskillfully. Unfortunately, I'm not used to situations like these in my life. So I pray that this won't be bite me in the ass. I managed to get closer to the man who stayed back, and as expected, he's not moving anywhere. I looked at my gun. My hands tremble.

I need to escape. But the only way is to… shoot the man. Will I do this…?

My mind went to a pause at that moment. For me, time itself was stopped. I started thinking. Thinking what would I be if I shoot this person. I began thinking if he has a family or not, I began thinking about what will happen if the police finds out. I need to do something…

My heart is beating like crazy…

I'm sorry man.

I pulled away from my cover, aiming as best as I can. I aim for the man's chest, trying to avoid on giving him instant death by shooting him in the face. I fired the first shot.

I heard bells.

I fired the second shot.

I heard screaming.

I fired the third shot.

I heard a cry.

My body trembled. My legs, my hands, my neck and even my shoulders. But my hand refuses to let go of the gun that I hold. I brought the gun close to my face, hands shaking.

I… I can't believe it. I shot a guy…

"Hey! Get down on the ground!"

Shit! I forgot about the other one. I ducked into cover immediately, finding the nearest to be a pile of wooden creates piled next to each other. My head peeked out, but only for me to retract back because of the shots that are fired at me. I gripped my gun with both hand, but still unable to return fire. My exit is the opposite way, in other words, if I want to escape, I need to get pass this guy.

"Get out I know you're in there!" he continues to fire more shots at me. I saw what type of guns he had. It's a revolver. Perfect. He only got three shots left. I brace my body, preparing myself at the same time to make the run. He fired his second to last shot at me. My body tensed.

He fired the last shot.

I reacted immediately, almost out of instinct. My feet run as fast as they can. The person is reloading behind cover, but I still fire shots to keep him busy longer. I don't know what gun that I have with me, but I can tell that it's about to run out of ammo. Jun didn't give me spare ammo. I don't know whether to feel relieved or worried about that. My exit is a stair that leads me down to the other side of the building that I'm on.

BANG!

Shit! He finished reloading. My body swooshed for cover. Dammit, I was so close. I don't know how many bullets I have with me, but I'm hoping that it'll be enough to get me out from this situation. He is still firing shots, his fourth. He got two shots left before he takes cover and reloads. He fired his fifth one, then his sixth. I took my chance to rise from cover, I aimed at the man, at that point, I don't care whether I'll hit him or not. I fired about eight shots, I don't know if they hit him or not.

I run straight for the ladder. I throw my gun away, seeing that I had no need for them. I slide down the ladder, falling on my back. I winced as I get my body up from the ground. I looked around. Good, I'm in the plaza. I need to find a fountain… fountain… there it is. my eyes landed on the sight of a not so familiar fountain. There're still gunfights all around, I don't know which one is which. So Jun, if did kill one of your dad's men, tell him I'm sorry.

I made way carefully towards the fountain, I duck and made way from cover to cover. I finally made it to the fountain, where I am still hiding like a little girl. I looked around, trying to find where this Porsche is. "Dammit Jun… Where the fuck are you- There!" I shouted to myself when caught sight of red Porsche, parallel parked. Who the fuck had time for parallel parking dammit!?

I proceed to advance towards my objective, Jun's ass. I swear if I see that bastard getting head from a woman while this shit storm is happening… I'll kick him in the nuggets. I am close to the car, all I have to do is to cross this crossfire. These people are firing guns like crazy! Isn't Japan supposed to be all brave and shit? Fuck, no use in thinking. I lay prone on the ground, finding it best to escape on the low. I'm so close now, I swear, if I get shot, I'll shoot myself in the-

"FUCK!"

Whoa that's close! A stray bullet nearly shot me, it's a good thing that a random guy went in front of me. Thank you random guy wearing fancy clothes. I stumble my way towards the car, finally reaching it. I opened the passenger seat, and got a gun shoved to my face. "Holy shit man it's me! It's me!" I raised my hand, too shocked to do anything.

"H-Holy shit you made it!" he looks glad… I immediately sit on the driver's seat, pulling the safety belts. I turn the car's engine on. I never drove a Porsche before, but I'm sure it's the same as driving a Toyota corolla.

"Yeah I did, and am about to save your life." I grumbled. I switch the gears to reverse, the car got shot but I don't care. Then I went straight for the road, away from this shit storm. I drove straight for the main streets, thinking that they won't come after us if I use a more public route. Looks like I was right. Three minutes driving, and no drive by shit happens. I breathe in relief, my shoulders relaxing.

"Whew…" I heard Jun doing the same thing. "Thanks man… really owe you big time now." He said, laughing.

"Yeah, you bet you do. You made me late for dinner with my girlfriend and I killed a guy… maybe!" Things got silent after I spoke. In all honesty, I'm pissed, tired and hurt. I actually think that I might have got shot. But thankfully, I wasn't.

"Hey, sorry man… didn't really mean for all this to go to shit you know…" Jun said solemnly.

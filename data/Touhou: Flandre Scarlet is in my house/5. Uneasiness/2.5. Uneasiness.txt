"Nothing too fancy, just sukiyaki." I said while walking towards the kitchen. Sakuya-san follows me. I set up the bags on the counter, placing them while releasing a sigh.

"Sukiyaki…?"

How could I forgot… she's from another dimension like world-

"Do you need assistance in making it?"

…I'm surprised that she knows what it is. Well, no use in getting surprised any longer. "Yes thank you, could you help prepare the…"

So the cooking went on, it went smoother than I expected. The maid outfit isn't just for show it seems, and Flandre was right when she said that Sakuya-san knows her way with a knife. Her cutting and chopping skills are superb. Though she has difficulty when it comes to turning on the stove, which was easily taught by her host, me. I do most of the preparation, while Sakuya-san does the cooking. It was finally my turn to cook, while Sakuya-san prepares the table.

After food was finally done, we waste no time on eating the food. I had never thought that sukiyaki would be this good, Flandre seemed to be showing the same kind of feeling as I am right now. I know that Sakuya-san enjoys it, she just doesn't show it. The sukiyaki is delicious, the combination of beef, mushrooms and vegetable all in one, cooked in a soup styled dish is definitely something that all people would enjoy. I personally like food which has soup in it, because I could savor them longer. But hey, anything will do as long as they're edible.

Our early dinner is done, and an hour had passed from all the cooking and eating. I collected all the bowls and plates, as well as the eating utensils, to clean them in the sink. Sakuya-san approached me. "Let me help." She said kindly.

"Ah, there's no need. Let me do the dishes, you helped me with cooking before so there's no need for you to help me again." I said, not wanting to trouble her. I'd be a very bad host if I let my guest do the dishes, Sakuya-san had insisted that she did the cooking earlier. I'm fine with that, but to do the dishes too? Not so much. So after getting all the dishes, I brought them to the sink.

While I'm enjoying my time cleaning the dishes, Sakuya-san and Flandre are over by the TV. They're watching that magical girl thinginabob. I hummed a tune, being a good mood does that to me sometime. I washed the final dish, rinsing it off and drying it with a dry towel. I'm done, all that's left is to take a bath. But it's still early, it's four. I usually take baths at around five or six, so like any other man out there with nothing to do; I hit the veranda to smoke.

Sliding open the veranda door, I perched my head over my arms while I rest my body on the railing. I don't have a good view over here but it's still enough to calm my nerves down whenever I needed to smoke. I pulled out a stick of cigarette from my pants pocket, I grab my lighter from the other pocket and began to flick it so that it could produce flames. As the flames lit the tip of the cigar, I waste no time in taking a deep drag of smoke before releasing them.

As I smoke, I set my view on the sky above. The sky is now a beautiful orange and purple color. I could stare at the sky all day and night, if not for the fact that I'm usually busy with doing projects given to me from campus. Thankfully, I haven't been getting much of those lately. As I smoke, my phone rings. I placed my cigar on the railing, hoping that it would not fall while I'm talking with whoever it is that is calling me.

I take my phone out from my pocket and without seeing the caller's ID, I answer it. "Hello?"

"Hello honey, it's me your mother."

"Mom?"

"Yes, your mother. How are you doing on getting a job, did you get one yet?"

"Yeah, I got it yesterday. The job's fairly simple, a waiter at a café. It pays well and it's not too far from here."

"Ah, good, good. Your father should've sent you your monthly allowances by tomorrow. He's in Beijing and was in a tight schedule until tonight."

"It's fine." I paused, not knowing what to say. "Hey uh… mom, what are your thoughts on me bringing home someone?"

"Ooh? What's this? You're bringing home girls to your room already?"

"No! It's just and if, a huge if. If I were to bring someone, not necessarily a girl, what should I do? And I'm talking about the type of person who doesn't have a place to stay."

"Are you bringing home homeless people with you?"

"No- argh! Just answer it mom."

"Just kidding with you sweetie. Now, about bringing home this someone… are you really sure that her or she is really homeless?"

"Well, no… she has a family."

"I knew it! You are bringing a girl home!"

"…Dangit mom, please answer, and be serious."

"Hehehe. So, if she have a family, why not return her home?"

Now I'm not sure if I could answer that. "Uh… she has a difficult relationship with her family, it's a very personal matter and I don't really want to make her uncomfortable by asking her a lot of questions."

"Nonsense, a family is a family, son. No matter how difficult their situation is, they will always worry for each other's safety. For now, just let her stay with you. Talk to her whenever she wants to talk to you and comfort her whenever she needs it. Just don't take it too far~."

"Mom!"

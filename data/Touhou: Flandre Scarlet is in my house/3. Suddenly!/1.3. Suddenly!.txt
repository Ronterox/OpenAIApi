"There's no helping it, it's summer after all. How about we go now so that we'll reach the shop quicker? You can keep the hoodie on the way." I said, finding that there is no better alternatives.

"Hng…" she moaned in dismay, but complying anyway. It must be a new experience for her… summer. Maybe she lives in Alaska or somewhere on the north where it's cold… who knows? Anyway, we better go right now or else we're wasting time. I began to take out of the apartment complex, right where we proceed with our fast paced walk.

Since Flandre is feeling uncomfortable under the sun, she's walking in a slower pace than I am. It confuses me why would she react this much when going outside… maybe she has a condition over this? Anyway, it's better to not make her feel uncomfortable. I stopped in the middle of our walk, to which Flandre follows.

"Here, I'll carry you. This way, we'll get there quicker." I kneel on one leg and gave her my back. I wait for a few seconds, still not feeling a familiar weight on my back. "Come on now, the sooner we get this done the sooner we can return home." It was then at that point where Flandre finally rests her body on my back. I lift my own weight plus the girl's, it's amazing on how light she is. "Hold on tight…" I murmured in warning as I began to walk in a fast pace.

In just a couple of minutes, I've exited the housing complex using the familiar short cut alleyway that I always took for university. Even in this time of the day the alley is still dark due to the shadow it emits when bathed in light. I exit the alleyway even before I knew it. The scene of people walking is familiar to me, I know that I've arrived at the street.

As I carried the hooded girl behind me, I felt her shifting in position. She must be uncomfortable, but so am I. This heat is too much for me in many ways, and I can't wipe the sweat of my forehead due to both of my hands being busy on carrying Flandre.

If I remember correctly, the clothing store that I usually visit is somewhere to the west, which means that I'll have to cross the road to get there. Perfect… please do note the sarcasm. Without thinking much about it, I crossed the road seeing that the light is still green.

Reaching the other side, I resume my walk towards the clothing shop, which is not far from here. As I walk, I can gradually notice the uncomfortable feeling that Flandre is feeling, since she is shifting so much on my back. Before I knew it, I started to get worried over an unknown reason. In the first place, why is Flandre like this? Does she have a very sensitive skin? I don't know why but my gut instinct told me to go faster.

And go faster, I did.

I knew that I was running now, I even startled a few people that I pass by. This isn't exactly the best course of action, since I do look pretty suspicious right now. Come on, a man carrying a teenage girl behind him? If that's not suspicious then I'm confused. I just hope that no one thinks the way I'm thinking right now…

As I run, I noticed that my grip on Flandre begins to slip off. I took a moment to stop and readjust my grip on her legs. I started to go again, but this time, I settled for a fast paced walk. I pant lightly, feeling a little worked out. I haven't been running much lately, maybe I'll do some morning run on the way to campus next time…

After walking for another five to six minutes, I've finally reached the store. It's a simple clothing store that sells some local brands, nothing too expensive. On the first few days when I've arrived at Tokyo, I was trying to find stores that sell clothes, and this is the closest and the cheapest one that I could find. They sell clothing for adults, kids of both gender… there should be things for Flandre in there. And the place is air conditioned, so there's no problem for Flandre having to be uncomfortable like this.

I entered the store by stepping into the mat. And automatically, the sliding door opens. Thankfully, the store isn't crowded, I doubt that it would, considering that it's just a small time clothes store… But this place works, and I'm not one who cares on what he's wearing anyway. Of course, there are some circumstances. I can't just walk in public in just my pajamas…

I set Flandre back to her feet, still maintaining a hold of her hand. I looked at her, and I noticed that she isn't as uncomfortable as before. I feel relief washing down my entire being, I do know why… but I do.

Flandre pulled back the hoodie, showing her face. I frown slightly as I see the look on Flandre's face. She looks… weak for some reason. I hope that she's not sick, or else I'll be dealing with all sorts of trouble. As I was busy with paying my attention towards the girl, I fail to notice the presence of a clerk on my back.

"Hello there, how may I help you?" I turned to look at who is talking to me. She's a clerk here, about the same age as me, if not older. She looks official, if not just doing her job.

"Eh… my…" I began to trail off, not knowing on how I should address Flandre. "My… niece here is looking for some clothes, you see, she's come here form overseas, but she forgot her bag at home, so I lent her my jacket. Can you please help her find something that suits her?" that's a pretty bad lie. Forgot her bag? Man…

The clerk giggled at the awkward smile that my face is pulling off. She nodded, a smile on her face. "Sure," she bent down, using her knees as support. "Little girl, come with me. I'll show you some nice clothes while your uncle waits here, okay?"

Flandre did not reply or whatsoever. She instead grips my hand tighter and used her other hand to cover herself using my legs. I laughed awkwardly, not exactly knowing on what to do. "Aha… she's quite the shy girl you see…" I placed a hand on Flandre's head. "Flan-chan, go with the nice Onee-san, I'll go and wait here. Okay?" I gave her an assuring smile, the most honest one that I could muster.

Flandre looked up from where she was standing, and her gaze meets mine. "Really? You won't go anywhere, Onii-san?"

Urk… that was dangerous… a niece calling her uncle Onii-san… now I'll get suspected for sure…

"Aww… what a cute girl, your uncle is young after all so it can't be helped… anyway, come with me Flan-chan, I'll help you on choosing some clothes." The clerk giggled. I can't believe that I'm safe… thank God… anyway, she's asking Flandre to come and follow her.

I gave one final reassuring look to Flandre. "It's fine kid, I'll wait here." I ruffled her hair one last time, before letting her go with the clerk. I saw Flandre's leaving form, slowly disappearing as she walks alongside the clerk to browse on some clothes. I sighed, walking towards the waiting couch. I seat there, waiting for Flandre to return with her clothing. As I sat, I observe the scene around me.

There are some people here, not only me and Flandre. Most are women, of course. I wonder… it's nowhere near winter but should I get some sweater…? It's still somewhere in the middle of summer, I guess not. And it's not like I'm finding some clothes for myself either, as I've said before, I'm a person who couldn't care less of what he's wearing.

For tonight, I plan on sleeping early, something that shouldn't be a problem for me. I need to wake up early tomorrow, since I have university to worry about. As I notice, as time pass by for that matter, my daily life has been… different from the usual. Usually, it is always in the same repetitive pattern: Wake up, eat breakfast, go to campus, return home, go shopping for dinner if needed, eat dinner, take a bath at public baths, and finally sleep.

But ever since Flandre shows up… that daily routine of mine has changed even though it's only a little bit. Where usually I would wake up at seven, I woke up at six this morning to cook breakfast for the both of us. I shop more when it comes to food, Flandre really like omurice for some reason. And now, I'm going out on shopping ever since a very long time. I don't shop much to begin with, and I only buy what I need, because my wants can come some other day.

It's safe to say that my everyday life of greyness and boredom has changed for the better… it's almost as if I'm enjoying life better, now that I have someone to look after. But still… Flandre has her family, and no matter if she's sent out by her family or what, they'll miss her sooner or later. I won't hide this… I'm kind of attached to the girl already, even though we just met for about four days ago. In such a short time, I can already feel my life changing whenever I look at Flandre's face in the morning.

It's like having to take care of a little sister… a sister who is really shy and timid. I did notice that I was smiling to myself. Today is another day, and just like any other day, I have to live it to the fullest. Especially when I have someone to take care of. I heard the sound of pitter patter coming towards my way; I unconsciously look towards the direction of where said noise is coming from. And as my vision landed on the sight that is before me, I can't help but blush.

There, walking towards me, is Flandre. Dressed in clothing that somehow befits her. She is dressed in a long sleeved skirt blouse with red trimmings. The main color of said blouse is red, though there are some designs with the color white on them. The skirt has frills on the edge, providing the most excellent cuteness appeal in my opinion. On her head, is a small red ribbon that is used to tie her ponytail. She's still wearing the same type of dress shoes that she's wearing, and the only thing that is different about her looks is the clothes.

"Here you go sir, your niece is as good as new." The clerk said with an amused tone. "Go on Flan-chan, show your uncle your new clothes." As the clerk said that, Flandre walked closer to me. She has a smile that I hadn't seen on her face. The smile is bright, a smile of happiness. It touched my heart the way a father would when he saw his daughter in the spotlight.

"How do I look, Onii-san?"
